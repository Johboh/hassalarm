    <string name="help_text_second">Start by editing your connection details for Home Assistant under \"Edit Connection\". Enter hostname, your long lived API token and the full entity ID name for your input_datetime input e.g. \"input_datetime.next_alarm\". Read more on how to configure a input_datetime that has both date and time in Home Assistant here: https://github.com/Johboh/hassalarm</string>
    <string name="help_text_third">For legacy reasons, you can also publish the next alarm as normal sensor using the format yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:00 (for example using entity ID sensor.next_alarm) and also using a API key instead of the recommended long lived token. This app will eventually drop support for this and input_datetime and longed lived token will be the only supported way (or any new ways).</string>
