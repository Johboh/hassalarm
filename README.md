# hassalarm
Android app for integration with Hass.io / Home Assistant as an `input_datetime` for the next scheduled alarm on the device.

Expect that alarm clocks schedule alarms properly which will trigger the system wide `ACTION_NEXT_ALARM_CLOCK_CHANGED`.
Once that happen, a call to your Hass.io instance will happen within an hour, given that there is an Internet connection. On failure, the Android OS will retry later.

## Home Assistant setup
1. Add a `input_datetime` with both date and time in your `configuration.xml`
  ```
  input_datetime:
    next_alarm:
      name: Next scheduled alarm
      has_date: true
      has_time: true
  ```
1. Add a time sensor in your `configuration.xml`:
  ```
  sensor:
  - platform: time_date
    display_options:
      - 'date_time'
  ```
1. If you want the value to persist on Home Assistant restarts, enable the [History](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/history/) and [Recorder](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder) components.
1. Add some automation for your new input:
  ```yaml
  automation:
    trigger:
      platform: template
      value_template: "{{ states('sensor.date_time') == (state_attr('input_datetime.next_alarm', 'timestamp') | int | timestamp_custom('%Y-%m-%d, %H:%M', True)) }}"
    action:
      service: light.turn_on
      entity_id: light.bedroom
  ```

Or if you want to trigger an automation five minutes before the alarm will go off:
```yaml
  automation:
    trigger:
      platform: template
      value_template: "{{ ((as_timestamp(states('sensor.date_time').replace(',','')) | int) + 5*60) == (state_attr('input_datetime.next_alarm', 'timestamp') | int)  }}"

    action:
      service: light.turn_on
      entity_id: light.bedroom
```

## Webhook support
HassAlarm supports updates through a webhook. This requires some setup on the Home Assistant side, but it greatly reduces the permissions the app has in Home Assistant.
To use a webhook for HassAlarm updates, you can use the automation below and adapt it as necessary. Note that your webhook ID should be hard to guess.

This automation will update Ã nd set the `input_datetime` for the entity ID specified in the app. Then you can use the `input_datetime` sensor in your automations as in the example above.
```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: webhook
    webhook_id: <your webhook id>
  action:
    service: input_datetime.set_datetime
    data_template:
      entity_id: "{{ trigger.json.entity_id }}"
      datetime: "{{ trigger.json.datetime }}"
```

## App usage
1. Install via [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fjun.hassalarm) or clone the repo and build the app: `./gradlew installDebug`
1. Create a [long lived token](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/#your-account-profile) on your profile or a webhook automation in Home Assistant.
1. Open the app and setup your hostname, longed live token and input_datetime entity ID: `input_datetime.next_alarm`
1. Schedule an alarm in any of your alarm apps

Once your device have a network connection, it should eventually do a call to the Hass.io API and your input_datetime should be set.

## Troubleshooting
1. Make sure the app is allowed to run in the background (e.g. start a sync job), read more here: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/6068458?hl=en (thanks [@Hooolm](https://github.com/Hooolm))
